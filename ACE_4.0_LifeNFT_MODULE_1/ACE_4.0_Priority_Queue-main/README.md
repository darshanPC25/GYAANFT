# BloodDonorNFT

**BloodDonorNFT** is a **Hive blockchain-powered** platform that incentivizes blood donation by rewarding donors with unique NFTs. This project seamlessly integrates **HiveAuth, Hive blockchain data reading, and Hive transaction broadcasting**, ensuring a **secure, decentralized, and transparent** blood donation ecosystem.

## Overview
BloodDonorNFT addresses the global challenge of blood shortages by leveraging **Hive blockchain** for immutable donation verification and NFT-based rewards. Hospitals validate donations, and donors receive **Hive-backed digital certificates (NFTs)** that can later be redeemed for benefits.

## Hive Blockchain Integration

BloodDonorNFT fully utilizes the **Hive blockchain** for:

**HiveAuth Authentication** â€“ Secure, decentralized login for users
**Hive Blockchain Data Read** â€“ Real-time retrieval of donation records and verification status
**Hive Transaction Broadcasting** â€“ Trustless and transparent recording of donation events on-chain
